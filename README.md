# OpenML Server
This is the Python-based OpenML REST API server.
It's a rewrite of our [old backend](http://github.com/openml/openml) built with a
modern Python-based stack.

> [!WARNING]
> This software is in early stages of development and not ready for production.

If you simply want to access data stored on OpenML in a programmatic way,
please have a look at connector packages in
[Python](https://openml.github.io/openml-python/main/),
[Java](https://github.com/openml/openml-java),
or [R](http://openml.github.io/openml-r/).

For information on getting started, please visit our [documentation](https://openml.github.io/server-api).
