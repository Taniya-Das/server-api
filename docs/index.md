# OpenML Server API Software Documentation

This is the Python-based OpenML REST API server.
It's a rewrite of our [old backend](http://github.com/openml/openml) built with a
modern Python-based stack.


!!! question "Looking to access data on OpenML?"

    If you simply want to access data stored on OpenML in a programmatic way,
    please have a look at connector packages in
    [Python](https://openml.github.io/openml-python/main/),
    [Java](https://github.com/openml/openml-java),
    or [R](http://openml.github.io/openml-r/).

    If you are looking to interface directly with the REST API, and are looking
    for documentation on the REST API endpoints, visit the
    [APIs](https://openml.org/apis) page.

    This documentation is for developing and hosting your own OpenML REST API.
