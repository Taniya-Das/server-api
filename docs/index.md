# OpenML Server API Documentation

This is the Python-based OpenML REST API server.
It's a rewrite of our [old backend](http://github.com/openml/openml) built with a
modern Python-based stack.


!!! question "Looking to access data on OpenML?"

    If you simply want to access data stored on OpenML in a programmatic way,
    please have a look at connector packages in
    [Python](https://openml.github.io/openml-python/main/),
    [Java](https://github.com/openml/openml-java),
    or [R](http://openml.github.io/openml-r/).
    This documentation is for developing and hosting your own OpenML instance.
